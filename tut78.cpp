                   // STL - STANDARD TEMPLATE LIBRARY //
/*
It is a library of generic classes and functions 
STL is used because of its reusability : well tested component
                           time saving

Components Of STL :-
 1. Containers - Store data and use template classes
 2. Algorithm - Sorting, searching and use template function
 3. Iterator - Object points to an element in a container
               handled just like pointer
               connects algorithm with container

Types Of Containers :-
 1. Sequence Container - linear fashion - e.g vector,list,queue
 2. Associative Constainer - Direct access - e.g set,multiset,map,multimap
 3. Derived Container - Real world modelling - e,g stack,queue

 Sequence Containers :-
  1. Vector - randomaccess=fast, insertion/deletion=slow, insertion at the end=fast
  2. List - randomaccess=slow , insertion at the middle=fast , insertiion/deletion=fast
 Associative Container :-
  all operatrions fast except RA
Derived Containers :-
 depends upon data structure
